_UNDERTALE Engine_ is committed to simplifying the process of making an _UNDERTALE_ fangame.
None of the codes was came from the original UNDERTALE.
It is based on _GameMaker Studio 2_, and almost everything will be developed on its latest version.

This engine includes: Battle, Overworld, Multi-language supports, and other features. [Some of them](https://github.com/TML233/gmu_console) are even open-source!

If you like this project, please star it and follow it on [GameJolt](https://gamejolt.com/games/undertale_engine/378055)!

We also have a [document page](https://tml233.github.io/undertale_engine/#/), but it is not finished yet.
